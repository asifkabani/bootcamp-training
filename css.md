## CSS
+ **Cascading Style Sheets** is used as a presentation layer (as opposed to HTML which is a structure and content layer); used to control style and appearance.
+ **Ruleset** is how a particular element should look. Below example shows the ruleset for the paragraph element. **Selector** is an element(s) that will be targeted by the declarations. In the same case, 'p' is the selector. **Declaration block** is a set of declarations, the items in between braces {} are declarations, contained within the declaration block. **Declarations** consist of a property and a value, example above (property: color, value: red).
```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 10px;
}
```
+ A **pseudo-class** is used to specify a special state of the element. A **pseudo-element** is used to style specified parts of an element.
