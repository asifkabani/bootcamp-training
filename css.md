## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is used as a presentation layer (as opposed to HTML which is a structure and content layer); used to control style and appearance.

Ruleset is how a particular element should look. Below example shows the ruleset for the HTML element 'p':
```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

Selector is an element(s) that will be targeted by the declarations. In the same case above, 'p' is the selector.

Declaration block is a set of declarations, example above the items in between {} are declarations, contained within the declaration block.

Declarations consist of a property and a value, example above (property: color, value: red).
