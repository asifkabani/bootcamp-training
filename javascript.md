# Javascript

+ JavaScript does two things: on the one hand, modeling and manipulating data and processes, and on the other hand, interacting with browser elements (which are represented using HTML).

+ The part of JavaScript that deals with modeling and manipulating data — that is, using variables, strings, numbers, logic, functions, etc. — is specified by ECMA (the European Association for Standardizing Information and Communication Systems). This organization creates the ECMAscript specification, which is a description of what a language called ECMAscript should implement. It's up to individual browsers to decide how to implement the features called for by the ECMAscript specification.

+ The part of JavaScript that deals with interacting with HTML elements — called the DOM (document object model) API, is specified by the W3C(World Wide Web Consortium), which is the same organization that creates the specification for HTML.

+ ***What*** JavaScript is gets specified by the ECMA and W3C specs. Individual browsers handle the how of implementing the ECMA and W3C specifications. As a programmer, your experience of using JavaScript on any particular browser is — for the most part — uniform. But behind the scenes, that JavaScript is getting interpreted by a browser that may support all, or only a subset of the features and requirements listed in a version of the ECMA and W3C specs.
