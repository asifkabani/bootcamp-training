## HTML
+ HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, it is used to mark up content so web browsers know what kinds of content they're dealing with.
+ HTML is about structure, meaning it specifies each and every one of it's elements and it specifies the hierarchical relationship between elements.
+ Semantic HTML means when you create content, to use the correct elements for that content, such as when you are adding an address use the ```<address>``` to specify the address instead of wrapping the address in a ```<p>``` tag.
Elements are individual HTML components that start with an opening and end with a closing tag and have content in between. Example of 'div' element below:
```html
<div>Some content</div>
```
Tags are used to mark off the beginning and end of an element. Both opening and closing tags consist of angle brackets, tag name, and the closing one has a forward slash '/'; Example of the 'div' tag below:
```html
<div></div>
```
Attributes are modifiers for an HTML element, used for setting properties on the HTML element. Example below of an attribute for the 'img' tag, 'src' is the attribute:
```html
<img src="">
```
Command to the page to parse the browser as HTML5 standards.
```html
<!DOCTYPE>
```

```html
<html>
```
This is where we put document meta data.

<head>
```
