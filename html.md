+ HTML is about structure, meaning it specifies each and every one of it's elements and it specifies the hierarchical relationship between elements.
+ Semantic HTML means when you create content, to use the correct elements for that content, such as when you are adding an address use the ```<address>``` to specify the address instead of wrapping the address in a ```<p>``` tag.
